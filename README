JabberBot - PHP XMPP Chat Bot

A chat bot written in PHP, to be used on an XMPP (Jabber) network.  Designed to be easily extendible and
customisable.  Contains a modified copy of XMPPHP v0.1 by Nathan Fritz.

This is not the kind of bot you can have an in-depth conversation with, it's built to recognise various 
commands and respond to them after performing whatever action you've associated with it.  It's ideal for 
interfacing with internal or external services.  Every command can be access controlled, and the Access Control
List can be manipulated via a chat session (subject to the same access controls of course).  The commands are
written in PHP as individual class files, so you'll need to be able to code PHP in order to extend the bot's
functionality.

php5 php5-cli php5-curl mysql-server mysql-client apache2 (for the api)
