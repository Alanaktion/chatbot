JabberBot Install Instructions

1. If you have ant installed, go to the JabberBot folder any type:
# ant install

Otherwise:
mkdir Config
cp Install/*.ini Config/

2. Edit both ini files in the Config/ folder with your Jabber server and db details.

3. Use the install.sql file to create the database tables.
First you'll need to create a database:
# mysql -uroot -p
> create database dbJabberBot;
> GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE on dbJabberBot.* TO 'user' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';  
(substitute whatever you want to use for the username and password here)

Then import the tables:
> use dbJabberBot;
> source Install/install.sql;

4. Configure Apache for the Api.
To enable the api, you need to somehow get the JabberBot/Public folder to be publicly acessible.
If you've only got a basic apache setup, then it'll probaby be enough just to add a simlink from /var/www, e.g:
# ln -s ~/JabberBot/Public /var/www/jabberbotapi

Then the api should be accessable at http://<host>/jabberbotapi

Alternatively you may need to set up a vhost.

5. Remote deployment
If you want to run the bot on a remote server, then you may find the auto-deploy script in the build.xml file useful.
First, you'll need to edit Install/deploy.properties giving details of the remote server.  Then:
# ant deploy
