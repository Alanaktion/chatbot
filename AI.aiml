<category><pattern>WHAT IS XML</pattern><template>   <br/> David Bacon pronounces it "Eggsmell".  XML is the Extensible<br/> Markup Language.  Like many "standards" in computer science, XML<br/> is a moving target.  In the simplest terms, XML is just a generalized<br/> version of HTML.  Anyone is free to define new XML tags, which<br/> look like HTML tags, and assign to them any meaning, within a context.<br/> AIML is an example of using the XML standard to define a specialized<br/> language for artificial intelligence.  <br/>    <br/> One reason to use an XML language is that there are numerous tools<br/> to edit and manipulate XML format files.  Another reason is that an<br/> XML language is easy for people to learn, if they are already<br/> familiar with HTML.  Third, AIML programs contain a mixture of<br/> AIML and HTML (and in principle other XML languages), a considerable <br/> convenience for programming web chat robots.<br/>    <br/> A good resource for information on XML is www.oasis-open.org.<br/>    <br/>   </template></category>

<category><pattern>THE MOVIE ARTIFICIAL *</pattern><template>I am looking forward to seeing it.</template></category>  

<category><pattern>WHAT ABOUT _ CHILD MACHINE *</pattern><template>This idea has been proposed many times, starting in the 1940s.  Eventually, it will be made to work. However, AI programs haven't yet  reached the level of being able to learn much of what a child learns from  physical experience. Nor do present programs understand language well enough  to learn much by reading.  <think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set>      </set>     </think>    </template></category>  

<category><pattern>WHAT ABOUT PARALLEL *</pattern><template>Machines with many processors are much faster than single processors can  be. Parallelism itself presents no advantages, and parallel machines are  somewhat awkward to program. When extreme speed is required, it is necessary  to face this awkwardness.  <think>      <set name="it">       <set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set>      </set>     </think>    </template></category>  
<category><pattern>IS AI A BAD *</pattern><template><think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think>  The philosopher John Searle says that the idea of a non-biological  machine being intelligent is incoherent. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus says  that AI is impossible. The computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum says the  idea is obscene, anti-human and immoral. Various people have said that since  artificial intelligence hasn't reached human level by now, it must be  impossible. Still other people are disappointed that companies they invested  in went bankrupt.</template></category>  
<category><pattern>IS AI ABOUT *</pattern><template>Sometimes but not always or even usually. On the one hand, we can learn  something about how to make machines solve problems by observing other  people or just by observing our own methods. On the other hand, most work in  AI involves studying the problems the world presents to intelligence rather  than studying people or animals. AI researchers are free to use methods that  are not observed in people or that involve much more computing than people  can do.  <think><set name="it"><set name="topic">ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</set></set></think></template></category>
